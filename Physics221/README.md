These are my **incomplete** worked problem sets for the course Physics 221: Classical Mechanics. I took this course during my first semester as an M.S. student in 2019.  The course was taught by Prof. Ian Vega and the main references were Goldstein (2001), Jos√© and Saletan (1998) and Lemos (2018).
